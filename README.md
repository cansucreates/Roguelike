# 2D Roguelike Game - Unity

This repository contains the project for the **2D Roguelike Game** that I created by following the Unity Learn **"2D Beginner: Adventure Game"** tutorial. The tutorial helped me dive deeper into Unity, focusing on more advanced programming concepts, task organization, and building a small vertical slice of a game.

## :game_die: **What this project is about:**

**Game Concept:**  
A 2D Roguelike game where you’ll implement:
- **Procedural dungeon generation**
- **Player movement**
- **Combat mechanics**

---

## :books: **Key Learnings:**

- **Organizing and Prioritizing Tasks:**  
  I learned how to break down a game idea into manageable tasks and prioritize features.

- **Complex Programming Concepts:**  
  This project covers more advanced C# scripting, focusing on:
  - Game state management
  - Code refactoring for better performance and organization

- **Pixel Art & Audio Integration:**  
  The game uses pixel art assets, and I learned how to integrate both graphical and audio assets into Unity.

- **Prototyping:**  
  By following the tutorial, I created a **vertical slice** of the game—essentially a small, functional part of the full game to test and demonstrate core gameplay features.

## :clipboard: **What’s in the Project:**

- **Procedural Dungeon Generation:**  
  Randomly generates new levels for the player to explore.

- **Player Movement and Combat Mechanics:**  
  Includes interactions with enemies and basic combat functionality.

- **Pixel Art Assets:**  
  Incorporates tiles, characters, and objects with a retro pixel art style.

- **Audio:**  
  Sound effects and background music to enhance the overall game experience.

## :bulb: **Feel free to explore the project!**

Since this project is based on a tutorial, some features might be in the early stages or subject to future updates. I hope you enjoy reviewing the code and structure as I continue to improve and expand on the game.
