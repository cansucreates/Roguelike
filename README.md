2D Roguelike Game - Unity
This repository contains the project for the 2D Roguelike Game that I created by following the Unity Learn "2D Beginner: Adventure Game" tutorial. The tutorial helped me dive deeper into Unity, focusing on more advanced programming concepts, task organization, and building a small vertical slice of a game.

What this project is about:
Game Concept: A 2D Roguelike game where you’ll implement procedural dungeon generation, player movement, and combat mechanics.

Key Learnings:

Organizing and Prioritizing Tasks: I learned how to break down a game idea into manageable tasks and prioritize features.

Complex Programming Concepts: This project covers more advanced C# scripting, focusing on game state management and code refactoring.

Pixel Art & Audio Integration: The game uses pixel art assets, and I learned how to integrate graphical and audio assets into Unity.

Prototyping: By following the tutorial, I created a vertical slice of the game—essentially a small, functional part of the full game to test and demonstrate the core gameplay features.

What’s in the Project:
Procedural Dungeon Generation that creates new levels randomly for the player to explore.

Player Movement and Combat mechanics, including interactions with enemies.

Pixel Art assets, including tiles, characters, and objects.

Audio to give the game a complete feel, including sound effects and background music.

Feel free to explore the project and see how it’s structured. Since this is based on a tutorial, some features might be in the early stages or subject to future updates.
